# CMake.js

CMake.js is a Node.js/io.js native addon build tool which works *exactly* like 
[node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp), 
but instead of [gyp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GYP_%28software%29), 
it is based on [CMake](http://cmake.org) build system.

Readme and tutorials are gonna be available soon. Until then please refer the help and take a look at the example projects in the tests directory.

Install:

```
npm install -g cmake-js
```

Help:

```
cmake-js --help
```
